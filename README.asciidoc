This library provides a Kamon module that can serve metrics to
http://prometheus.io/[Prometheus], an open source service monitoring system and
time series database.  Since Prometheus uses a scraping mechanism and its own
data model, this module bridges the gap between the two.  It converts Kamon
metrics into a Prometheus-friendly format and provides integrations for both
Spray and Akka HTTP so that your application can serve metrics to Prometheus.

Features
--------

* Converts Kamon metrics data to conform to Prometheus’ data model, including:
** Reasonably handles all Kamon entities, including custom entities
** Preservation of units of measurement
* Provides Spray and Akka HTTP route that supports:
** Both text and https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[Protocol
   buffer] representation formats
** Optional gzip compression
* Allows collection of snapshots without an endpoint using an actor
* Allows configuration of:
** Refresh interval to match Prometheus
** Metric subscriptions to export
** Additional Prometheus labels on exported metrics

Installation
------------

In order to use this module, you will need to add the following dependency to
your `build.sbt`:

[source,scala]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
libraryDependencies += "com.monsanto.arch" %% "kamon-prometheus" % "0.2.0"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may also need to add JCenter as a resolver:

[source,scala]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
resolvers += Resolver.jcenterRepo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kamon’s module loader should automatically detect the presence of
_kamon-prometheus_ and start it.  However, in order to be useful, you will need
to <<Usage,include the extension’s Spray or Akka HTTP routes somewhere in your
service>> so that Prometheus can invoke it.


Dependencies
------------

This module depends on:

* http://akka.io[Akka actors]
* http://kamon.io[Kamon core]
* https://github.com/typesafehub/config[Typesafe config]
* https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[Protocol buffers for Java]
* http://akka.io[Akka HTTP] _(optional)_
* http://spray.io/[Spray routing] _(optional)_
* https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators[Scala parser combinators] _(optional)_

Additional dependencies are required if you are interested in
<<building,building the library>>.


Configuration
-------------

You can configure the module much like any other Kamon module, by modifying
your `application.conf`.  All of the configuration entries for
_kamon-prometheus_ are placed under `kamon.prometheus`.

=== Refresh interval

The `kamon.prometheus.refresh-interval` setting determines how often the
_kamon-prometheus_ will flush and serve new data.  This setting must be at
least as large as `kamon.metric.tick-interval`, and should match Prometheus’
`scrape_interval`.  The default refresh interval is one minute, which matches
Prometheus’ default.

=== Subscriptions

Like most other Kamon reporting module, _kamon-prometheus_ allows you to
configure the metric categories to which the module will subscribe.  By
default, the following subscriptions are included:


[source,scala]
.The default _kamon-prometheus_ subscriptions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
kamon.prometheus {
  subscriptions {
    histogram        = [ "**" ]
    min-max-counter  = [ "**" ]
    gauge            = [ "**" ]
    counter          = [ "**" ]
    trace            = [ "**" ]
    trace-segment    = [ "**" ]
    akka-actor       = [ "**" ]
    akka-dispatcher  = [ "**" ]
    akka-router      = [ "**" ]
    system-metric    = [ "**" ]
    http-server      = [ "**" ]
    spray-can-server = [ "**" ]
  }
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


=== Additional labels

_kamon-prometheus_ will automatically add a metric’s tags, name, and category
to a published metric as labels.  If you which to add additional labels, you
can add them under the `kamon.prometheus.labels` path, which is empty by
default.

For example, given:

[source,scala]
.The default _kamon-prometheus_ subscriptions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
kamon.prometheus {
  labels {
    application_name = "my cool app"
    application_version = "42"
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All metrics published by _kamon-prometheus_ will add the labels
`application_name="my cool app"` and `application_version="42"` to all
published metrics.  Keep in mind  that label names may munged to fit
http://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels[Prometheus’ naming requirements].


Usage
-----

There are currently three principal ways to use _kamon-prometheus_:

1. Using the Spray endpoint
2. Using the Akka HTTP endpoint
3. Collecting metrics via an Actor

Once you have made the metrics available, you will need to configure
Prometheus to scrape your application.

=== Using the Spray endpoint

The module provides a Spray route which you can access via
`SprayEndpoint(system).route` where `system` is an actor system.  You can
place this route anywhere in your application, but keep in mind that Prometheus
scrapes `/metrics` by default.  The following is the code for a minimal
application that will serve metrics from `http://localhost:8888/metrics`:

[source,scala]
.A minimal Spray application
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import com.monsanto.arch.kamon.prometheus.spray.SprayEndpoint
import spray.routing.SimpleRoutingApp

object Main extends App with SimpleRoutingApp {
  implicit val actorSystem = ActorSystem()

  startServer("localhost", 8888) {
    path("metrics") {
      SprayEndpoint(actorSystem).route
    }
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the route will only respond to `GET` requests and will automatically
handle compression and media type negotiation.  If there is no content yet
(generally before the first set of metrics has been collected), the route will
return a _No Content_ response (204).

=== Using the Akka HTTP endpoint

Using the Akka HTTP endpoint is just like using the Spray endpoint above,
except that you use a different Akka extension.

[source,scala]
.A minimal Akka HTTP application
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import com.monsanto.arch.kamon.prometheus.spray.SprayEndpoint
import spray.routing.SimpleRoutingApp

object Main extends App with SimpleRoutingApp {
  implicit val actorSystem = ActorSystem("Demo")

  startServer("localhost", 8888) {
    path("metrics") {
      SprayEndpoint(actorSystem).route
    }
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Getting snapshots with an actor

For this functionality, please consult the documentation for
http://monsantoco.github.io/kamon-prometheus/api/0.2.0/#com.monsanto.arch.kamon.prometheus.PrometheusExtension[PrometheusExtension].

=== Consuming the metrics

Finally, all you need to do is
http://prometheus.io/docs/operating/configuration/#scrape-configurations-scrape_config[configure
a scrape configuration in Prometheus].  The following snippet is a minimal
example that shold work with the minimal server from the previous section.

[source,yaml]
.A minimal Prometheus configuration snippet
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: example
    target_groups:
      - targets: ['localhost:8888']
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the above configuration uses the default `scrape_interval` (one
minute, matching _kamon-prometheus’_ default.) and `metrics_path` (`/metrics`).


Development
-----------

[[building]]
=== Building the library

You can use `sbt` to build the library, but you will need to have Google’s
protocol buffers compiler `protoc` on your path.  You can
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads[download]
Protocol buffers directly from Google.  However, there may be simpler options.
For example, on OS X, you can use http://brew.sh[homebrew] and just `brew
install protobuf`.

Additionally, to build the demo, you will need to have Docker set up.
